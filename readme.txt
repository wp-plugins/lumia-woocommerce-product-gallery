Lumia woocommerce product gallery modified the normal woocommerce product gallery with Elevate Zoom Jquery

== Description ==

Elevate Zoom works best using two images, one low resolution for the visible image, and one high resolution for the zoomed image. If you only have one image available, Elevate Zoom will still work if you scale down the image, although this is not recommended as your page load time will increase if you are loading larger images

.
Features
* Admin interface for controlling product gallery
* Fully Customisable
* Coloured Tints
* Fancybox Gallery Support
* Variable zoom on mouse scroll
* External Controls
* Window Zoom, Lens Zoom and Inner Zoom
